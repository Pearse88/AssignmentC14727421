1st assignment for OOP

Introduction
<br />
The dataset I have based my assignment on, is one that is very close to me.  Having been a diehard Glasgow Celtic Footbal Club fan for the whole of my life, I thought it would be a interesting journey for myself to learn more about the fanbase of the club I love.  When I first set out about finding a suitable dataset it appeared it was going to be dificult to find a specific subject to base the assignment on. </br>
The dataset that was decided upon was the average attendances at Celtic home games from a time period between 1980 and 2014.  The datasets in which I encountered for this particlar subject was very sparce and in fact I only found one website that contained such data.  The data can be found through this link(http://www.fitbastats.com/celtic/club_records_league_attendance.php).  The dataset only states the higest lowest and average attendances and not each attendance for every home match that was played in a given season.  My sketch allows the user to navigate from a title page to two other pages thus far.
</br>

The Data Visulization graph which I choose to use for my dataset was a trend line graph. The graph is quite simple as it is, I do intend to expand on this trend graph to make it more visually appealing.  I also hope to add some user interaction by displaying the attendances of which the user will press the mouse upon. 
</br> </br>

Changes and Improvements
</br>
I will be making some changes and improvements to my assignment as it is now.  As said above the assignment is very basic so far.  I plan to add some more features and data visulizations to the assignment. To do this I have set upon getting a new dataset based on the Celtic f.c fanbase.  
</br>
My plan is to include a data visulization based on season ticket holders worldwide.  The graph will display every country that has a season ticket holder, and how many fans hold season tickets in that country.  </br>
Being a massive Celtic supporter as I am, alot has been made of the drop in attendances at Celtic Park since Rangers Football Club got relegated in 2012. I plan to show the difference in attendances between 2012 to present, and the previous 4 years where Rangers where still present in the Scottish premier League. 
</br>

User Instructions
</br>
When the sketch is first executed the user will be met by a title page from here they can navigate their way through each data visulization.  If the user select 1 they will be brought to a trend line graph that shows the average attendances since 1980.  If the user enters 2 they will be met by a picture of the Celtic F.C fans.  I have not yet coded in anymore visulizations as stated in Changes and Improvements above.

EDITED
</br>
Since my last submission there have been some changes to the sketch. The user is still met with the same opening screen as seen in the screenshot below. 

Opening screen
</br>
![Alt text](https://github.com/Pearse88/AssignmentC14727421/blob/master/attendeces/menu.png "Opening page")



As you can see above the sketch prompts the user to enter 1 or 2 if the user enters 1, they will be met by the screen below in fig(1,a).
If the user enters 2, they will be met by the screen in fig(1,b).

Fig(1,a)

From here the user can chose to press 0 to go back to the home screen or press 2 to go to the next visuliation.  When the user presses 2 they will be met by the screen below.

fig(1,b)
</br>
![Alt text](https://github.com/Pearse88/AssignmentC14727421/blob/master/attendeces/fanBase.png "Fanbase page")

From here the user can scroll over each green circle and this will reveal how many fans there are in each of the continents. For e.g. in Europe there are approx 4.75 million Celtic F.C fans.


Changes
</br>
As stated above in my first submission I have made some changes although I did not stick to the changes first  outlined. I have however entered another visulization to my sketch.  The reason for the change, is because i felt that the previous visulization showed how the attendances have dropped in the last five years.
The new visulization that is present on my sketch, is a breakdown of the fan base worldwide, the fanbase is broke down into continents.  You will see in the user instructions some screen shots of how the final sketch turned out.
</br>

Findings
</br>
Before undertaking this assignment, my understanding of the Celtic fc fanbase worldwide was in my opinion second to none, however to my surprise I found that my knowledge was not as good as I had thought.  To my surprise Celtic F.C were said to have an estimated 9 million fans worldwide and ranked in the top 20 of most surpported football teams in the world in 2012.  With over 160 supporters clubs in over 20 countries worldwide. 
It is a well known fact that Celtic F.C fans are one of the best set of fans in the world.  And in 2003 for the UEFA cup final celtic fc fans set a record for the most fans to attend a final with over 80,0000 fans turning up to support.  

Conclusion
</br>
In conclusion this assignment was very useful to me both as a computer science student and as a huge Celtic fan. As a student I learned to make sure you research and think about the assignment before going gun hoe into coding, which unfortunately I did, and found it very hard to keep track of where I was. As a Celtic fan I found out a lot of new fun facts and figures about the club I have supported all my life.  And in a funny way they are both connected, I thought I knew everything about Celtic and I didn't think I needed to research or figure out what dataset to chose.  In the same way I thought I knew how to code the problem but turned that was also a lot more work than I first thought.
